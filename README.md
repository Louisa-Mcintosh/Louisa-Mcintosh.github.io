## Overview

This **Weather App** allows users to input a city name, view the current temperature, and see a 7-day weather forecast, including daily weather icons, temperatures, and a time slider for daily variations. The weather data shown is static (not integrated with a live weather API), but it can be extended to fetch real-time data from an external weather API such as **OpenWeatherMap**.

## Features

- **Search for a city**: Users can input the name of a city to check its current weather.
- **Weather details**: Displays current temperature, weather icons, and additional details such as the time range for daily variations.
- **7-day forecast**: Shows the weather forecast for the upcoming week with the expected high and low temperatures.
- **Interactive time slider**: A range slider to view the time-based variations of the weather (morning to evening).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Custom styles and layout.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and layout components.
- **JavaScript** (optional for future extension): Can be added to fetch live weather data from APIs.
  
The project currently focuses on the front-end part, demonstrating the ability to create a weather interface with **static data**.
